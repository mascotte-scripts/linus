# Linus Framework [Work In Progress]
Linus is a lightweight & user friendly roleplaying framework for FiveM. It is the first FiveM framework of it's kind to be completely independent of any 3rd party dependencies such as using a mySQL database. The user-friendly layout and code modulation of Linus makes it simple to navigate and make changes to, regardless of coding skill. Development commenced on the project in early summer 2021, by Mascotte45 & N0tSomething - however, many many people have contributed to this project since it's conception, whether be it directly or indirectly (Refer to Notes section for full list of noted contributions)

# Installation

- Download the latest release from the side tab, and extract the folder 'linus' and it's contents to your resource folder.
- Alternatively, clone the repo using `https://github.com/mascotte-scripts/linus.git`
- Copy `valkyrie.cfg, LinusConfig.cfg, LinusPerms.cfg` from the linus folder to the same folder as `server.cfg` 
- Add to server.cfg: 
`exec valkyrie.cfg
exec LinusConfig.cfg
exec LinusPerms.cfg`
- FiveM appearance is not currently modulated, you will need to run this resource separately
